# Introduction

## What is DEEPSPACE?
DEEPSPACE (DPS) is a 3D space-themed play to earn game based in the DEEPSPACE universe created by a team of lifelong gamers and engineers. The project aims to bring a fun and addictive game mechanics to the crypto space rather than a focus on .

Launched in August 2 2021 DEEPSPACE leverages NFTs as player assets. Mint, Buy and Sell NFT ships, land, and equipment on our custom marketplace built in-house specifically to support the DEEPSPACE game.

Space ships in DEEPSPACE are unique and upgradable SmartNFTs designed by in-house blockchain experts, allowing players to level up their ships by way of upgrades built with resources that can be mined in-game.

$DPS is the official token of DEEPSPACE ecosystem and economy and is available on both BNB Chain and Ethereum. $DPS is the in-game currency for DEEPSPACE and not for investment purposes.

## Genre
DEEPSPACE is a unique MMO blend of first-person 3D space exploration, turn-based strategy combat, and action racing e-sports.

## Why DEEPSPACE?
DEEPSPACE has a "Game First" vision to be a cutting-edge game that players want to play and compete in for fun.  We believe with a solid game design and engaging foundation, the implementation of a blockchain-backed economy comes naturally and reliably rather than feeling forced. Where most "crypto games" are focused on crypto/blockchain concepts, our goal is to simply be a great and addictive game with an emphasis on the traditional gamer audience.

We are focused on bringing a great and addictive game to as many people around the world as possible, supporting an array of platforms and devices - not just the latest cutting edge hardware.

## Background

Why Blockchain?
What does blockchain and crypto bring to gaming? Player asset ownership. 

Players may spend hundreds or even thousands of hours playing a game such as World of Warcraft, upgrading characters, collecting equipment or "loot" and building a war chest of game currency such as gold or silver. However if a player decides to retire from the game, what happens to their assets? Give them away to friends? Thousands of hours of time invested with nothing to show for it outside of the game. What else do you spend large amounts of time building up assets or learning skills and have nothing to show for it when complete? Most all hobbies, outside of gaming, result in tangible assets or skills.

Enter the blockchain and NFTs. Blockchain provides an asset ownership system in which the player truly owns their assets in the form of NFTs or cryptocurrency tokens. They can remove them from the game, buy, sell or transfer ownership to other players or even non-players for game token cryptocurrency and trade that cryptocurrency token for any other cryptocurrency or fiat via an Exchange. It provides a fair, transparent and secure mechanism to allow players to have something to show for their time investment in a game by listing characters, equipment or resources for sale on NFT marketplaces for other players to then use to play.

In addition to asset ownership, it also provides the ability for game assets to span across multiple games even from different gaming companies enabling a true Metaverse experience. Traditional game assets are tied to the game, you cannot use your game character or equipment in another game. Blockchain removes this limitation by transferring asset tied to a public, decentralized storage location (the blockchain) allowing any other game to utilize the assets from another game. For example a DEEPSPACE ship NFT is not tied to DEEPSPACE alone. It is a publicly available but privately owned asset. Any game created by any game studio could create a game and allow DEEPSPACE ship NFT assets to be used within their game.

Multi-Chain
The goal of DEEPSPACE is to be chain agnostic and allow players to utilize their chain of choice when bridging out assets.  Currently both BNB Chain and Ethereum are supported.

## Game Engine
Unity Game Engine
Utilizing the Unity Game Engine, was a natural choice as it is the top platform in the industry for mobile games and cloud scalable games.

Unity is easier to use for smaller teams and powers some of the world's most popular mobile games, including Pokémon Go and Activision’s recent Call of Duty: Mobile (Bradshaw, Tim; Kruppa, Miles, 2021).

### Security Focused and Cloud First Strategy
The team has built each proprietary technology from the ground up with a security-focused, cloud-first mindset. These types of mindsets further improve user confidence and ensure scalability and accessibility as the service grows across the world. In addition, the team's focus on the cloud has inherently kept the infrastructure costs down, ensuring more resources can be spent on marketing, development, and other key focuses of the project.
