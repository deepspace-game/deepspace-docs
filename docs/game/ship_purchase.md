# Getting Ships

To purchase a ship visit The Outpost to purchase an existing ship that meets the criteria you desire. The Outpost is currently on BNB Chain only. To purchase ships on Ethereum, see the OpenSea links below. There are plans to move the ship marketplace into the game, making it chain agnostic.

By using [The Outpost](https://docs.deepspace.game/deepspace-dps/v/deepspace-app-and-marketplace/inventory/what-is-inventory/listing-selling-a-ship) to source your ship, you can select the ship model/class, core type, and stats of your choosing. Of course there may be a premium to pay for this luxury. Ship pricing is set by the ship owner listing it for sale.

[The Outpost](https://docs.deepspace.game/deepspace-dps/v/deepspace-app-and-marketplace/inventory/what-is-inventory/listing-selling-a-ship) is also the place to list your ships for sale to other players.
