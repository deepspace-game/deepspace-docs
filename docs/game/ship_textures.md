# Textures and Rarity

Each ship model currently has 20 different textures or skins that it can have, for a total of 80 textures across all ships.

Textures are dynamically generated at the time of mint and are determined by the same randomness used to generate other properties such as model, core, and stats.

There are 5 levels of rarity that textures fall into, each with it's own border color to it's card.

The following table indicates the color associated with each rarity level as well as the chances that a ship will be built with a texture of that rarity.
