# Exploration Events

A number of different events can happen while traveling through DEEPSPACE including discovering lost cargo, finding ship wreckage, being raided by pirates or getting attacked (coming soon).

## Lost Cargo

When discovered, lost cargo will appear as a loot chest floating in space and highlighted in pink. You will receive an alert notification letting you know that lost cargo has been discovered. It's up to you to find it near your current location. If you move too far away from the cargo, it will be lost and disappear. Fly over the chest to collect it's resources.

The Luck stat of your lead ship can result in bonus cargo being discovered.

## Ship Wreckage

On rare occasions you may stumble upon the wreckage of another ship that was previously destroyed. Searching wreckage can result in finding resources. 

The mining level of your lead ship will determine the number of resources you are able to find among it.

## Space Pirates

Beware! Space pirates lurk throughout DEEPSPACE and will attack you if they see you! When attacked by pirates you will need to defeat them at [Combat](../game/combat_overview.md)
