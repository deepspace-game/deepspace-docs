# About Collections

Ship collections (generations) are grouping of ships created by certain manufacturers and may only be available to mint during limited times.

Each ship collection has a unique set of models and textures as they are build by different manufacturers and different factions. A fighter class ship from one collection, will look different than a fighter class ship from another collection.

At this time, only the Genesis Collection is available.

## Generation Abilities
In addition to the look of a ship model, each ship class has a unique ability that can be used within the DEEPSPACE game.

Ship abilities are unique to that class and generation. For example, a tank from one generation will have a different ability than a tank from another generation.

Details on each classes generational ability can be found in collection specific sections of this guide on the follow pages.
