# Contributing to DEEPSPACE Docs

## Using this Repository

To contribute effectively, you should have a basic understanding of GitHub and branching workflows.

1. **Start with `main`**: Always start with a freshly pulled `main` branch before making any changes. Checkout `main`, pull the latest changes, then create a new branch for your work.
2. **Commit and PR Workflow**: After committing and pushing your branch, open a Pull Request (PR) with the title `main <- <your branch>`.
3. **Branch Naming and PR Comments**: Use descriptive names for branches and PR comments to clearly indicate the purpose of your changes.
4. **Request Reviews on Discord**: This repository is not actively monitored, so please notify the team in Discord to ensure your PR is reviewed and merged promptly.

**Note**: Changes will be automatically built and deployed to the CDN once your PR is approved and merged.

## Using MKDocs

Our documentation is built with [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), an open-source documentation platform that supports Markdown.

- **Game Documentation Location**: The game documentation files are in the [Game](https://github.com/deepspace-game/deepspace-docs/tree/main/docs/game) folder. Documentation is broken down into sections using Markdown to keep information manageable.
- **Images**: Place images in the `img` folder. Reference an existing page if you need examples of image linking syntax.  
  - **Formats**: Use `.png` or `.gif` formats as needed.  
  - **Size**: Ensure images are optimized for web use to keep the repository lightweight and quick to load.

## Style and Formatting

- **Markdown Standards**: Follow basic Markdown standards. Use headers, lists, and code blocks as necessary.
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names for files, e.g., `player-guide.md`.
- **Commit Messages**: Keep commit messages concise yet descriptive.
